Our location is one of the best: we are in between the main church (Parish of Our Lady of Guadalupe) and the main square (Plaza de Armas which is adjacent to the city hall). We are located in one of the most privileged weather with almost 300 suny day per year. 26Â° Celsius pretty much all year long and in a bay where you will enjoy every day an unforgettable sunset. Feel safe while you experience the wonders of this magical beach paradise called Puerto Vallarta. "
